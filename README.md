This project was created as a backend server to a frontend application, https://github.com/softwaresally/starter-movie-front-end

It's purpose is to give information about movies, theaters and reviews of movies. It also shows which movies are showing at which theaters.

This project displays my ability to work with knex as well as writing code for creating, deleting, listing, and updating data.
